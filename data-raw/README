# Step 1 - Retrieve a list of repositories

The list of GitHub repositories is obtained using https://seart-ghs.si.usi.ch/
The following filters were applied: 
 - Created at: before 2022-01-01
 - Last commit at: after 2022-01-01
 - Number of commits: min 100
 - Number of stars: min 100
 - Exclude forks: true

Retrieval date: 2022-09-05
The resulting csv file is "repositories.csv"


# Step 2 - Retrieve GitHub workflows

For each repository, we extracted the content of its ".github/workflows" folder.
Here are the steps we followed to make this process faster:
 - Create an empty folder; 
 - Change directory to that folder;
 - Initialize an empty git repository;
 - Set its remote origin:  "git remote add origin URL";
 - Enable sparse checkout: "git config core.sparsecheckout true"
 - Select folder(s) to checkout: "echo '.github/workflows' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout";
 - Pull default branch: "git pull origin BRANCH"

This process is performed by the "Extract repositories" notebook and may take a long time!


# Step 3 - Analyse yaml files to retrieve workflows, jobs and steps

This step explores the downloaded repositories and extracts data from their workflow files.
The process is performed by the "Extract workflows" and "Extract workflow data" notebooks. 
These notebooks output data files into the "data" folder.


# Step 4 - Retrieve releases for identified Actions

This step aims to retrieve the "official" releases (as reported on GitHub) for the Actions identified
during the previous step. The process is performed by the "Extract releases" notebook.
