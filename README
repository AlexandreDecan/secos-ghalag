This repository contains the replication package for our analysis on the technical and opportunity lags of GHA workflows w.r.t. Actions.

The replication package requires Python 3.8+ and a bunch of dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. 
The notebooks are expected to be executed in a Jupyter lab environment. 

The `data` folder contains all the data required to replicate the notebooks. These data were obtained by the various `Extract {x}` notebooks. These notebooks require additional data from the `data-raw` folder (refer to the README file within this folder for more information). The only exception is `data/lag.csv.gz` that is generated by the `Compute technical lag` notebook. 

The following datasets are available: 

 - workflow_files.csv.gz contains the list of workflow files (their unique hash) contained in repositories for various snapshots; 
 - workflows.csv.gz associates the data available within workflow files with their unique hash;
 - jobs.csv.gz associates the data available in jobs with their workflow files; 
 - steps.csv.gz associates the data available in steps with their workflow files and jobs; 
 - releases.csv.gz contains the releases extracted from GitHub for the various Actions found in the steps; 
 - lag.csv.gz exposes the mapping between Actions referred in steps and releases of Actions.
 
Details about the content of these files and how to manipulate them can be found in the notebooks.
